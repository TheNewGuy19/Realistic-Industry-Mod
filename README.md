# Realistic-Industry-Mod
Minecraft mod I'm working on, designed to be very difficult but rewarding in various ways. 
It will likely primarily be structured on highly customizable/upgradable multiblocks, with some single-block machines sprinkled in. 
There will be a large variety of weapons for use in warfare, and we are aiming to make a partially custom vehicle system, and a fully custom firearm system.
Tech-wise we are going for more complex and rewarding than something like GregTech, with a modest focus on various ages of technology and the progression through them. 
There will be no focus on a tiered system of technology, but rather having something a lot more player-oriented, meaning that you can entirely change what happens to your technological level if you have the correct amount of information to do so. 
Our main aim with the mod is to make it highly complex but also fun for less experienced players, who might want to just shoot stuff with big cannons or make explosives using chemicals. 

We currently plan to release on an age basis, aka the first release will be stone age tech and will be very similar to terrafirmacraft, second will be copper, third will be bronze, fourth will be iron, etc.
